## Welcome to GIST!

GIST! is a very freeform and streamlined ruleset, inspired by the Free Kriegsspiel Revolution and Old School Renaissance movements, based on the most famous old school sci-fi RPG, but intended to be used in any setting or genre. The system is designed to be very flexible and hackable. Hacks are indeed encouraged and welcomed.

## GIST! Editions:
GIST! is available in two flavors: core and FKR Edition. The core edition is also available in Italian.

*[GIST! core](GIST!.md)
*[GIST! core (italian)](GIST!_ita.md)
*[GIST! FKR Edition](GIST!_FKR.md)
